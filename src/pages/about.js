    <h3>What is Weekly Digest?</h3>
    <p>
      I made this site to shows all of the articles I've read on Pocket, by
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I don't blog this is a different way of sharing the subjects and topics
      that I find interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time I plan to add more features, such as stats, and different ways
      to search and order articles.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Pocket?</h3>
    <p>
      I use the{" "}
      <a href="https://getpocket.com" target="_blank">
        Pocket
      </a>{" "}
      read it later app a lot. I add loads of articles, and when I get a spare
      moment, I try and use Pocket, rather than hitting Twitter or Facebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pocket is great, because it strips out all of the ads and other
      extraeneous parts of an article, and just gives you the text. It also
      works offline, which is a lifesaver on my daily commute, as I go through
      quite a few reception cold spots. It's great having something interesting
      to read wherever I am.
